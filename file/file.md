In Java, **Externalization** is a mechanism for custom serialization of objects, where you have more control over the process of reading and writing the object’s state. It is achieved by implementing the `Externalizable` interface from the `java.io` package.

Unlike the `Serializable` interface, which uses default serialization, `Externalizable` requires explicit implementation of the methods for writing and reading object data.

### Steps to Externalize a Class

1. **Implement the `Externalizable` Interface**:
    - A class that needs to be externalized must implement the `Externalizable` interface.
    - This interface has two methods:
        - `writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)`: Writes the object state to an `ObjectOutput` stream.
        - `readExternal(ObjectInput in)`: Reads the object state from an `ObjectInput` stream.

2. **Provide a Public No-Argument Constructor**:
    - The class must have a public no-argument constructor because the `Externalizable` mechanism creates an object using this constructor before calling `readExternal`.

3. **Override the `writeExternal` and `readExternal` Methods**:
    - Define what and how the object's state should be saved and restored.

### Example of Externalizing a Class

Here is an example that demonstrates how to externalize a class:

#### Code Example
```java
import java.io.*;

class Employee implements Externalizable {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private transient String password; // Will not be serialized unless explicitly handled

    // Public no-argument constructor
    public Employee() {
    }

    public Employee(String name, int age, String password) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.password = password;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }

    // Implementing writeExternal to serialize the object's state
    @Override
    public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException {
        out.writeUTF(name);
        out.writeInt(age);
        // Explicitly serialize the password
        out.writeUTF(password != null ? password : "");
    }

    // Implementing readExternal to deserialize the object's state
    @Override
    public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        name = in.readUTF();
        age = in.readInt();
        password = in.readUTF();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + ", password='" + password + "'}";
    }
}

public class ExternalizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee("Alice", 30, "secure123");

        // Serialize the object
        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("employee.ser"))) {
            oos.writeObject(emp);
            System.out.println("Object has been serialized: " + emp);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Deserialize the object
        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("employee.ser"))) {
            Employee deserializedEmp = (Employee) ois.readObject();
            System.out.println("Object has been deserialized: " + deserializedEmp);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Implementation**:
    - The `Employee` class implements the `Externalizable` interface.
    - It overrides the `writeExternal` and `readExternal` methods to specify how the object’s state is serialized and deserialized.

2. **Serialization**:
    - The `writeExternal` method explicitly writes the values of the fields `name`, `age`, and `password` to the `ObjectOutput` stream.

3. **Deserialization**:
    - The `readExternal` method reads the values from the `ObjectInput` stream and restores the state of the object.

4. **Transient Fields**:
    - Unlike `Serializable`, the `Externalizable` interface does not automatically serialize transient fields. You must explicitly include them in the `writeExternal` and `readExternal` methods if required.

### Output of the Example
```plaintext
Object has been serialized: Employee{name='Alice', age=30, password='secure123'}
Object has been deserialized: Employee{name='Alice', age=30, password='secure123'}
```

### Key Points About Externalization
1. **Control**:
    - Externalization provides full control over the serialization process, allowing you to customize how the object is saved and restored.

2. **Performance**:
    - It can be more efficient than default serialization if only specific fields need to be serialized.

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
    - Changes to the class structure (e.g., adding/removing fields) are easier to handle with externalization compared to default serialization.

4. **Security**:
    - Sensitive fields (like passwords) can be excluded or encrypted during serialization.

5. **No-Argument Constructor**:
    - The class must have a public no-argument constructor for deserialization to work.

By following these steps and guidelines, you can effectively externalize a class in Java for custom serialization needs.
