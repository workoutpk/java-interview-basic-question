## I'll help you understand thread states in the context of ExecutorService and CompletableFuture in Java.



```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ThreadStatesDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Create an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        
        // Create a task that will sleep for a while
        Runnable sleepingTask = () -> {
            Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
            System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " starting - State: " + currentThread.getState());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000); // TIMED_WAITING state
                System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " waking up - State: " + currentThread.getState());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " interrupted!");
            }
        };

        // Create a task with synchronization to demonstrate BLOCKED state
        Object lock = new Object();
        Runnable blockingTask = () -> {
            Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
            System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " trying to acquire lock - State: " + currentThread.getState());
            synchronized (lock) {
                System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " acquired lock - State: " + currentThread.getState());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        };

        // Submit tasks to ExecutorService
        System.out.println("Submitting tasks to ExecutorService...");
        Future<?> future1 = executor.submit(sleepingTask);
        Future<?> future2 = executor.submit(blockingTask);
        
        // CompletableFuture example
        System.out.println("\nDemonstrating CompletableFuture...");
        CompletableFuture<String> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
            System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " in CompletableFuture - State: " + currentThread.getState());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return "Task Complete";
        }, executor);

        // Add a callback to the CompletableFuture
        cf.thenAccept(result -> {
            Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
            System.out.println(currentThread.getName() + " processing result: " + result + 
                             " - State: " + currentThread.getState());
        });

        // Wait for completion
        try {
            future1.get(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            future2.get(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            cf.get(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Demonstrate thread state monitoring
        Thread monitoringThread = new Thread(() -> {
            ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
            ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadMXBean.dumpAllThreads(false, false);
            System.out.println("\nCurrent thread states in the pool:");
            Arrays.stream(threadInfos)
                  .filter(info -> info.getThreadName().contains("pool"))
                  .forEach(info -> System.out.println(info.getThreadName() + 
                                                    " - State: " + info.getThreadState()));
        });
        monitoringThread.start();
        monitoringThread.join();

        // Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();
        if (executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            System.out.println("All tasks completed, executor shut down successfully");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Executor shutdown timed out");
        }
    }
}

```

Let me explain the key concepts demonstrated in this code:

1. Thread States:
    - NEW: Thread is created but not yet started
    - RUNNABLE: Thread is executing or ready to execute
    - BLOCKED: Thread is waiting for a monitor lock
    - WAITING: Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread
    - TIMED_WAITING: Thread is waiting for a specified time
    - TERMINATED: Thread has completed execution

2. ExecutorService:
    - Manages a pool of threads
    - Handles thread creation and lifecycle
    - Can submit both Runnable and Callable tasks
    - Provides Future objects for task results

3. CompletableFuture:
    - Supports asynchronous programming
    - Can chain multiple operations
    - Allows composition of tasks
    - Provides better exception handling

The code demonstrates:
- Thread state transitions using sleep() (TIMED_WAITING)
- Synchronization causing BLOCKED state
- Async execution with CompletableFuture
- Thread monitoring and state observation
- Proper executor shutdown

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?


# Creating CompletableFutures:

*`supplyAsync(Supplier<U>)`: Creates a CompletableFuture that completes when the supplied Supplier returns a result.
*`runAsync(Runnable)`: Creates a CompletableFuture that completes when the supplied Runnable finishes executing.
*`completedFuture(U value)`: Creates a CompletableFuture that is already completed with the given value.
*`failedFuture(Throwable ex)`: Creates a CompletableFuture that is already completed exceptionally with the given exception.
