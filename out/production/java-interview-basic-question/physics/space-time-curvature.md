The equation describing spacetime curvature is encapsulated in **Einstein's Field Equations** (EFE) from General Relativity. These equations relate the curvature of spacetime to the energy and momentum of matter and radiation present.

The general form of Einstein's Field Equations is:

\[
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\]

### Components of the Equation:

1. **\(G_{\mu\nu}\)**: The Einstein tensor, which describes the curvature of spacetime. It is defined as:
   \[
   G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu}
   \]
    - \(R_{\mu\nu}\): Ricci curvature tensor, describing the degree to which spacetime is curved.
    - \(R\): Ricci scalar, the trace of \(R_{\mu\nu}\).
    - \(g_{\mu\nu}\): The metric tensor, describing the geometry of spacetime.

2. **\(\Lambda\)**: The cosmological constant, accounting for the energy density of empty space (dark energy).

3. **\(T_{\mu\nu}\)**: The stress-energy tensor, which encapsulates the distribution and flow of energy, momentum, and stress in spacetime.

4. **\(\frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}\)**: A constant of proportionality, where:
    - \(G\): Gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\)).
    - \(c\): Speed of light in vacuum (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Simplified Context:
For specific cases, like a spherically symmetric mass distribution (e.g., a star or black hole), the equations simplify to solutions such as the **Schwarzschild solution**, describing the curvature outside a spherical, non-rotating mass:
```markdown
$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)c^2dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\Omega^2
$$
```

where \(d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2\).

### Significance:
Einstein's Field Equations are central to modern physics, describing phenomena such as:
- Black holes.
- Gravitational waves.
- The expansion of the universe.
- The bending of light near massive objects (gravitational lensing).
