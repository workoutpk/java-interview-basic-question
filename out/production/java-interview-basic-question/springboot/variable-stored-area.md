In Java, **static** and **final** variables are stored in specific areas of memory managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Here's a detailed explanation of where these variables are stored and their characteristics:

## Storage Areas for Static and Final Variables

### 1. **Static Variables**
- **Location**: Static variables are stored in the **Method Area** of the JVM, which is part of the heap memory. In Java 8 and later, this area is referred to as **Metaspace**.
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Class-Level Scope**: Static variables belong to the class rather than any specific instance. This means they are shared among all instances of that class.
    - **Lifetime**: The lifetime of static variables coincides with the lifetime of the class. They are created when the class is loaded into memory and destroyed when the class is unloaded.
    - **Initialization**: If a static variable is not explicitly initialized, it is given a default value (e.g., `0` for integers, `null` for objects).

### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    static int staticVariable = 10; // Static variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + Example.staticVariable);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Final Variables**
- **Location**: Final variables can be either instance variables or static variables.
    - If declared as static, they are stored in the Method Area (Metaspace).
    - If declared as instance variables, they are stored in the heap memory as part of the object.
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Immutability**: Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This applies to both static and instance final variables.
    - **Initialization Requirement**: Final variables must be initialized when they are declared or in the constructor (for instance variables), otherwise a compilation error will occur.

### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    static final int STATIC_FINAL_VARIABLE = 20; // Static final variable
    final int instanceFinalVariable;

    public Example(int value) {
        this.instanceFinalVariable = value; // Must be initialized in constructor
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Static Final Variable: " + STATIC_FINAL_VARIABLE);
        Example obj = new Example(30);
        System.out.println("Instance Final Variable: " + obj.instanceFinalVariable);
    }
}
```

## Summary

- **Static Variables**: Stored in the Method Area (Metaspace) and shared across all instances of a class. They have a lifetime equal to that of the class itself.
- **Final Variables**: Can be either static (stored in Method Area) or instance-level (stored in heap memory). They cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

Understanding where these variables are stored helps in managing memory effectively and writing efficient Java applications.
## Storage Area of function caller information and local varibale
- **Local Variables**: Stack memory is primarily used to store local variables that are declared within functions. These variables are created when a function is called and are automatically deallocated when the function exits13.
Function Call Information: Each time a function is invoked, a new block of memory, known as a stack frame, is allocated on the stack. This frame contains all the information needed to manage the function call, including local variables and return addresses23.
- **Temporary Data**: Data stored in stack memory is temporary and only exists for the duration of the function call. Once the function execution completes, the stack frame is removed, and all associated data becomes invalid24.
- **Automatic Management**: The allocation and deallocation of stack memory are handled automatically by the operating system. This means programmers do not need to manually manage this memory, which helps avoid memory leaks15.
- **LIFO Structure**: Stack memory operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle,
