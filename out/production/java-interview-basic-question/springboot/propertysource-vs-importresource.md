The `@PropertySource` and `@ImportResource` annotations are both used in Spring framework applications, but they serve different purposes:

1. **@PropertySource**:
    - `@PropertySource` is used to load external property files into the Spring application context.
    - It allows you to specify one or more resource locations (e.g., `classpath:/application.properties`) where property files can be found.
    - These property files can then be used to configure various parts of your application, such as database connection details, API keys, or feature flags.
    - The properties loaded by `@PropertySource` can be accessed using the `@Value` annotation or through the `Environment` object.

2. **@ImportResource**:
    - `@ImportResource` is used to load XML-based Spring configuration files into the application context.
    - In older versions of Spring, the primary way to configure a Spring application was through XML files (e.g., `applicationContext.xml`).
    - `@ImportResource` allows you to include these XML-based configuration files in your Java-based Spring application.
    - This is useful when you have existing Spring applications that rely on XML configuration, and you want to gradually migrate them to a more modern, annotation-based configuration.

The main differences between the two are:

1. **Configuration File Format**: `@PropertySource` is used to load property files (typically in the `.properties` or `.yaml` format), while `@ImportResource` is used to load XML-based configuration files.
2. **Configuration Type**: `@PropertySource` is used to load configuration values, like database connection details or feature flags, while `@ImportResource` is used to load the overall application configuration, including bean definitions, AOP settings, and other Spring-specific settings.
3. **Recommended Approach**: In modern Spring applications, it's generally recommended to use `@PropertySource` to load external configuration values, and to use Java-based configuration (using `@Configuration` and `@Bean`) instead of XML-based configuration. This makes the application configuration more explicit and easier to manage.

In summary, `@PropertySource` is used to load external property files, while `@ImportResource` is used to load XML-based Spring configuration files. The recommended approach is to use `@PropertySource` for configuration values and Java-based configuration for the overall application setup.
