The `escape()` and `unescape()` functions in JavaScript are used for encoding and decoding strings, primarily for URL handling. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

## Key Differences

- **Functionality**:
    - **`escape()`**: This function encodes a string by converting characters that are not ASCII into their hexadecimal escape sequences. It is typically used to make a string safe for use in a URL. For example, it will convert spaces into `%20` and special characters into their respective escape sequences[1].
    - **`unescape()`**: This function decodes a previously encoded string, replacing escape sequences with the characters they represent. For instance, it will convert `%20` back to a space[1][3].

- **Encoding Scope**:
    - **`escape()`**: Encodes all non-ASCII characters, which means that if the input string contains only ASCII characters, the output will be identical to the input[1].
    - **`unescape()`**: Only decodes escape sequences that were produced by `escape()`. It does not evaluate escape sequences in string literals or handle different encoding schemes like UTF-8[3].

- **Deprecation**:
    - Both functions are deprecated in modern JavaScript. Developers are encouraged to use `encodeURIComponent()` and `decodeURIComponent()` instead for URL encoding and decoding, as these newer functions provide better support for various character sets and are more reliable[1][3].

## Example Usage

Here’s how you might use these functions:

```javascript
// Encoding a string
var encodedString = escape("Hello world!"); // "Hello%20world!"

// Decoding the encoded string
var decodedString = unescape(encodedString); // "Hello world!"
```

### Conclusion

While `escape()` and `unescape()` were useful for handling URL parameters, they have been largely replaced by more robust methods. It's advisable to use `encodeURIComponent()` and `decodeURIComponent()` for encoding and decoding strings in modern JavaScript applications.
