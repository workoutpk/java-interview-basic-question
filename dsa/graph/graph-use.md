Graphs are extensively used to model and solve real-world physical problems. Here are several key applications:

Transportation Networks:
- Road systems with intersections as vertices and roads as edges
- Airline routes with airports as nodes and flight paths as edges
- Railway networks for optimizing train schedules and routes
- Public transit systems for planning bus/subway routes

Utility Infrastructure:
- Electrical power grids with transformers as nodes and power lines as edges
- Water distribution networks with pumping stations, reservoirs, and pipes
- Telecommunications networks for optimizing signal routing
- Gas pipeline systems for efficient distribution

Molecular Structures:
- Chemical compounds with atoms as vertices and bonds as edges
- Protein interaction networks
- DNA/RNA structure analysis
- Crystal lattice structures

Social Networks:
- Friend relationships on social media
- Professional networks in organizations
- Disease transmission patterns
- Communication patterns in communities

Computer Networks:
- Internet topology with routers as nodes
- Local area networks (LANs)
- Data center architectures
- Wireless sensor networks

Supply Chain Management:
- Manufacturing processes
- Warehouse distribution networks
- Logistics optimization
- Inventory management systems

For example, in electrical power grids:
1. Nodes represent:
    - Power plants (generation)
    - Substations (transformation)
    - Distribution points
    - End consumers

2. Edges represent:
    - Transmission lines
    - Power flow directions
    - Capacity constraints
    - Distance/resistance

Engineers use graph algorithms to:
- Find shortest paths for power routing
- Minimize transmission losses
- Identify potential failure points
- Plan network expansions
- Optimize load distribution

This graph representation helps solve critical problems like:
- Load balancing
- Fault detection
- Redundancy planning
- Maintenance scheduling
- Emergency response
