You should use a **ConcurrentHashMap** in Java when you need a thread-safe collection that allows concurrent access to its elements with high performance. Unlike `HashMap`, which is not thread-safe, and `Hashtable`, which is synchronized and can block all threads during access, `ConcurrentHashMap` provides a balance between concurrency and performance.

### **When to Use ConcurrentHashMap**

1. **Concurrent Read and Write Access**
    - If multiple threads need to read and write data concurrently without explicit synchronization.
    - Example: A shared cache that multiple threads read from and update.

2. **Thread-Safe Alternative to HashMap**
    - When you need thread safety for a shared map but don't want the entire map locked during read/write operations.
    - Example: Logging thread-specific data in a multi-threaded application.

3. **High Performance in Concurrent Environments**
    - When high performance is critical, and the overhead of using `Hashtable` (synchronized on every operation) is too high.
    - Example: Real-time data processing systems.

4. **Frequent Reads with Occasional Writes**
    - `ConcurrentHashMap` is optimized for read-heavy operations. Read operations do not block other threads, even if write operations are happening concurrently.
    - Example: Configuration settings that are updated infrequently but accessed frequently.

5. **Fine-Grained Locks**
    - The internal structure of `ConcurrentHashMap` uses **segment locks** or a similar mechanism to allow multiple threads to access different parts of the map concurrently.
    - Example: Systems where multiple threads update independent sections of the map simultaneously.

6. **Avoid Manual Synchronization**
    - When you don't want to manually synchronize a `HashMap` using `synchronized` blocks.
    - Example: Simplifying code in multi-threaded applications.

### **Features of ConcurrentHashMap**

1. **No Null Keys or Values**
    - Unlike `HashMap`, `ConcurrentHashMap` does not allow `null` keys or `null` values.

2. **Segmented Locking**
    - It divides the map into segments, and only the segment being modified is locked, allowing other segments to be accessed by other threads.

3. **Iterators Are Weakly Consistent**
    - Iterators do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException` and reflect the state of the map at the time of their creation.

### **Use Case Example**

#### **Scenario: Shared Cache**
If you are building a web application with a shared cache that multiple threads (e.g., HTTP request handlers) access and update:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class SharedCache {
    private static ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Add a value to the cache
        cache.put("user1", "John Doe");

        // Concurrently read and write to the cache
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User1: " + cache.get("user1"));
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            cache.put("user2", "Jane Smith");
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### **When Not to Use ConcurrentHashMap**

1. **Single-Threaded Applications**
    - If your application is single-threaded, use `HashMap` for better performance without the thread-safety overhead.

2. **Heavy Write Operations**
    - If there are frequent updates to the map and contention is very high, consider other data structures or synchronization mechanisms.

3. **Need for Null Keys/Values**
    - Use `HashMap` or `Hashtable` if `null` keys or values are required.

4. **Immutable or Read-Only Map**
    - If your map is immutable or read-only, you can use `Collections.unmodifiableMap()` or `Map.of()` for better efficiency.

### **Comparison: HashMap vs Hashtable vs ConcurrentHashMap**

| **Feature**             | **HashMap**         | **Hashtable**         | **ConcurrentHashMap** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Thread Safety            | No                 | Yes (synchronized)     | Yes (fine-grained locks) |
| Null Keys/Values         | Allowed            | Not allowed           | Not allowed           |
| Performance              | Fast (single-threaded) | Slower (locks entire map) | High (concurrent reads/writes) |
| Iterators                | Fail-fast          | Fail-fast             | Weakly consistent     |

### **Conclusion**
Use **ConcurrentHashMap** when you need a high-performance, thread-safe map for concurrent access in multi-threaded environments, especially when read operations dominate write operations. It strikes a balance between safety and speed, making it an ideal choice for concurrent applications.
