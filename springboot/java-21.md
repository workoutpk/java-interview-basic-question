Java 21, released in September 2023, introduces several powerful features and enhancements aimed at improving performance, productivity, and developer experience. Hereâ€™s a summary of the major features in **Java 21**:

---

### **1. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**
- **Status**: Finalized
- Virtual threads make multithreaded programming more efficient by decoupling threads from the underlying operating system threads.
- They are lightweight and allow you to scale thousands or even millions of threads easily.
- **Benefits**:
    - Simplifies concurrent programming.
    - Reduces resource consumption for high-concurrency applications.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
      executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread"));
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Pattern Matching Enhancements**
- **Record Patterns and Pattern Matching for switch**:
    - Further refinement of pattern matching introduced in earlier Java versions.
    - Enables more expressive and readable code by combining patterns in `switch` and `instanceof`.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  record Point(int x, int y) {}

  void printPoint(Object obj) {
      switch (obj) {
          case Point(int x, int y) -> System.out.println("Point: " + x + ", " + y);
          case null -> System.out.println("null");
          default -> System.out.println("Unknown");
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Sequenced Collections**
- **Status**: New API
- Introduces `SequencedCollection`, `SequencedSet`, and `SequencedMap` interfaces to support collections with a defined encounter order (e.g., insertion order).
- Adds methods like `reversed()`, `first()`, and `last()`.
- **Benefits**:
    - Standardized way to handle ordered collections.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  SequencedSet<String> names = LinkedHashSet.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
  System.out.println(names.first());  // Alice
  System.out.println(names.reversed());  // [Charlie, Bob, Alice]
  ```

---

### **4. String Templates (Preview)**
- Adds string templates for embedding expressions directly in strings, improving readability and reducing errors.
- **Syntax**:
    - Use `STR.` prefix and `${}` for embedded expressions.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  String name = "John";
  String greeting = STR."Hello, ${name}!";
  System.out.println(greeting);  // Hello, John!
  ```

---

### **5. Scoped Values (Preview)**
- Provides an alternative to thread-local variables that works better with virtual threads.
- Scoped values allow thread-safe access to values with predictable performance in concurrent applications.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  ScopedValue<String> currentUser = ScopedValue.newInstance();

  try (var scope = ScopedValue.where(currentUser, "Alice")) {
      System.out.println(currentUser.get());  // Alice
  }
  ```

---

### **6. Generational ZGC (Improved Garbage Collector)**
- Enhances the **Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)** with generational capabilities.
- Improves performance by segregating short-lived and long-lived objects into separate generations.
- **Benefits**:
    - Reduced pause times.
    - Better resource management for large-scale applications.

---

### **7. Foreign Function & Memory API (Finalized)**
- **Status**: Finalized
- Allows Java programs to call native libraries and manage memory outside the JVM more safely and efficiently.
- Replaces JNI (Java Native Interface) with a modern API.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100)) {
      MemoryAccess.setInt(segment, 0, 42);
      int value = MemoryAccess.getInt(segment, 0);
      System.out.println(value);  // 42
  }
  ```

---

### **8. Deprecations and Removals**
- **Removed**: `RMI Activation` system.
- **Deprecated**: Certain older APIs and features, such as `Object.finalize()`.

---

### **9. Library Improvements**
- **Collections**:
    - New methods in `List`, `Set`, and `Map` for easier element access and modification.
- **Streams**:
    - More streamlined operations, e.g., `Stream.ofNullable` enhancements.
- **Regex**:
    - New methods and improvements to support advanced regular expressions.

---

### **10. Preview Features Summary**
- **String Templates**: For embedding expressions in strings.
- **Scoped Values**: For better thread-safe value management.
- **Unnamed Patterns and Variables**: Allows placeholders for unused variables in patterns.

---

### **Why Java 21 is Significant**
1. **LTS Release**: Java 21 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, meaning it will receive extended support and updates, making it ideal for production environments.
2. **Modern Features**: Virtual threads, string templates, and generational ZGC simplify development for modern, high-performance applications.
3. **Focus on Productivity**: Enhancements in pattern matching, collections, and APIs reduce boilerplate and increase code readability.
