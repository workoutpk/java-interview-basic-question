The key differences between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java revolve around **thread safety**, **performance in multi-threaded environments**, and **features**. Below is a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Thread Safety**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - Not thread-safe. It can lead to inconsistent behavior if accessed by multiple threads without external synchronization.
    - Using a `HashMap` in a multi-threaded environment requires manual synchronization via `synchronized` blocks or wrapping with `Collections.synchronizedMap()`.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Thread-safe. Designed for concurrent access, it allows multiple threads to operate on the map without requiring external synchronization.
    - Implements fine-grained locking via **lock striping** to improve performance.

---

### **2. Concurrency Mechanism**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - Does not support concurrent modifications and throws a `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified while iterating using an iterator.
    - Suitable for single-threaded environments.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Uses **internal segmentation** or **bucket-level locking** to allow multiple threads to operate on different parts of the map simultaneously.
    - Iterators are **weakly consistent**, meaning they reflect the state of the map at some point during or after the iterator's creation, without throwing exceptions during concurrent modifications.

---

### **3. Null Keys and Values**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - Allows **one null key** and **multiple null values**.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Does **not allow null keys or null values**. Attempting to insert `null` throws a `NullPointerException`. This restriction avoids ambiguity in concurrent scenarios.

---

### **4. Performance**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - Offers better performance in single-threaded environments since it has no thread-safety overhead.
    - External synchronization significantly reduces performance in multi-threaded environments.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Optimized for multi-threaded environments due to its fine-grained locking mechanism.
    - Avoids locking the entire map, unlike synchronized versions of `HashMap`, enabling higher throughput.

---

### **5. Locking Granularity**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - No locking by default.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Uses fine-grained locking, where only specific buckets are locked during updates, allowing better concurrency and less contention.

---

### **6. Iteration**

- **`HashMap`**:
    - Iterators are **fail-fast**, throwing `ConcurrentModificationException` if the map is modified during iteration (other than through the iterator's own `remove` method).

- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**:
    - Iterators are **weakly consistent**, meaning they tolerate concurrent modifications without throwing exceptions, but may not reflect real-time changes.

### **Code Example**

#### **HashMap**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("A", 1);
        map.put("B", 2);
        map.put(null, 3); // Allows one null key

        System.out.println(map);

        map.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(k + ": " + v));
    }
}
```

#### **ConcurrentHashMap**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        map.put("A", 1);
        map.put("B", 2);

        // map.put(null, 3); // Throws NullPointerException

        System.out.println(map);

        map.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(k + ": " + v));
    }
}
```

### **Summary Table**

| Feature                  | `HashMap`                       | `ConcurrentHashMap`              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety**        | No                              | Yes                              |
| **Null Keys/Values**     | Allows one null key, multiple null values | Does not allow null keys or values |
| **Concurrency Control**  | External synchronization required | Internal fine-grained locking    |
| **Iteration**            | Fail-fast                      | Weakly consistent                |
| **Performance**          | Best in single-threaded         | Best in multi-threaded           |
| **Use Case**             | Single-threaded or rarely modified | Multi-threaded environments       |

Use **`HashMap`** in single-threaded environments or when thread safety is not a concern. Use **`ConcurrentHashMap`** in multi-threaded environments for better concurrency and performance.
