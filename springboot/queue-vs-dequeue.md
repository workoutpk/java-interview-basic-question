The primary difference between a **queue** and a **deque** lies in their structure and the operations they support. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:

---

### **Queue**
1. **Definition**:
    - A queue is a **linear data structure** that follows the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.

2. **Key Operations**:
    - **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back (tail) of the queue.
    - **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front (head) of the queue.
    - **Peek**: Views the front element without removing it.

3. **Characteristics**:
    - Only allows insertion at the rear and removal from the front.
    - Provides unidirectional access.

4. **Example**:
    - Imagine a line at a ticket counter where people are served in the order they arrive.

5. **Java Implementation**:
    - `Queue` is an interface in Java, implemented by classes like `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`, etc.

### **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**
1. **Definition**:
    - A deque (short for **Double-Ended Queue**) is a **linear data structure** that allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends (front and rear).

2. **Key Operations**:
    - **Add/Remove at Front**: `addFirst()`, `removeFirst()`.
    - **Add/Remove at Rear**: `addLast()`, `removeLast()`.
    - **Peek**: Views elements at both ends, e.g., `peekFirst()`, `peekLast()`.

3. **Characteristics**:
    - Supports bidirectional access.
    - Can be used as both a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO).

4. **Example**:
    - A deque can model scenarios where both ends need simultaneous access, like a deque-based task scheduler.

5. **Java Implementation**:
    - `Deque` is an interface in Java, implemented by classes like `ArrayDeque` and `LinkedList`.

### **Comparison Table**

| **Feature**           | **Queue**                      | **Deque**                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Insertion**          | Only at the rear               | Both front and rear                   |
| **Removal**            | Only from the front            | Both front and rear                   |
| **Access**             | Unidirectional (FIFO only)     | Bidirectional (FIFO or LIFO)          |
| **Flexibility**        | Limited                        | More flexible                         |
| **Implementation**     | `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`  | `ArrayDeque`, `LinkedList`            |

### **Example Code in Java**

#### Queue Example:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        queue.add(10); // Enqueue
        queue.add(20);
        queue.add(30);

        System.out.println("Queue: " + queue);

        System.out.println("Dequeued: " + queue.remove()); // Dequeue
        System.out.println("Peek: " + queue.peek()); // View front element
        System.out.println("Queue after dequeue: " + queue);
    }
}
```

#### Deque Example:
```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

public class DequeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

        deque.addFirst(10); // Add at front
        deque.addLast(20);  // Add at rear
        deque.addFirst(5);

        System.out.println("Deque: " + deque);

        System.out.println("Removed from front: " + deque.removeFirst()); // Remove from front
        System.out.println("Removed from rear: " + deque.removeLast());   // Remove from rear
        System.out.println("Deque after removals: " + deque);
    }
}
```

### **Use Cases**

1. **Queue**:
    - Task scheduling.
    - Print job management.
    - BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal.

2. **Deque**:
    - Sliding window problems.
    - Implementing a stack or queue.
    - Palindrome checking.
