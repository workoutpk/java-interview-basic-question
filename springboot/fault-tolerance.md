To implement fault tolerance using the Circuit Breaker design pattern, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Define the Circuit Breaker**:
    - Create a `CircuitBreaker` class that encapsulates the logic for opening, closing, and half-opening the circuit.
    - The circuit breaker should have the following states:
        - **Closed**: The normal state where requests are allowed to pass through to the underlying service.
        - **Open**: The state where the circuit breaker trips and all requests are rejected.
        - **Half-Open**: The state where the circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to pass through to the underlying service to test its availability.

2. **Implement the Circuit Breaker Logic**:
    - In the `CircuitBreaker` class, define methods for each state transition:
        - `callWithCircuitBreaker(Callable<T> call)`: This method wraps the actual call to the underlying service and handles the circuit breaker logic.
        - `open()`: This method is called when the circuit breaker detects a failure and needs to trip the circuit.
        - `close()`: This method is called when the circuit breaker determines that the underlying service has recovered and the circuit can be closed.
        - `halfOpen()`: This method is called to transition the circuit breaker to the half-open state, allowing a limited number of requests to test the service's availability.

3. **Define Failure Criteria**:
    - Determine the criteria for when the circuit breaker should trip the circuit, such as:
        - Number of consecutive failures
        - Failure rate percentage
        - Elapsed time since the last successful call

4. **Implement the Failure Detection Logic**:
    - In the `callWithCircuitBreaker()` method, monitor the underlying service calls and track the success or failure of each call.
    - Based on the defined failure criteria, decide when to trip the circuit breaker by calling the `open()` method.

5. **Implement the Recovery Logic**:
    - In the `halfOpen()` method, allow a limited number of requests to pass through to the underlying service to test its availability.
    - If the test requests are successful, call the `close()` method to reset the circuit breaker to the closed state.
    - If the test requests fail, call the `open()` method again to keep the circuit breaker in the open state.

6. **Configure the Circuit Breaker**:
    - Provide configuration options for the circuit breaker, such as:
        - Failure threshold (e.g., maximum number of failures before tripping the circuit)
        - Timeout duration for the open state
        - Delay before transitioning to the half-open state

7. **Integrate the Circuit Breaker**:
    - Wrap the calls to the underlying service with the `callWithCircuitBreaker()` method provided by the `CircuitBreaker` class.
    - Ensure that the circuit breaker is properly initialized and configured before making service calls.

Here's a simple example in Java using the Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker library:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    private final CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;

    public MyService(CircuitBreakerFactory<?, ?> circuitBreakerFactory) {
        this.circuitBreaker = circuitBreakerFactory.create("my-service");
    }

    public String getData() {
        return circuitBreaker.run(() -> {
            // Call the underlying service
            return externalService.getData();
        }, throwable -> {
            // Handle the fallback logic when the circuit breaker is open
            return "Default data";
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CircuitBreaker` is configured and created using the `CircuitBreakerFactory` provided by Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker. The `getData()` method wraps the call to the external service using the `run()` method of the `CircuitBreaker`. If the underlying service call fails, the circuit breaker will trip, and the fallback logic will be executed.

The key aspects of this implementation are:
- Defining the circuit breaker's states and transitions
- Implementing the failure detection and recovery logic
- Providing configuration options for the circuit breaker
- Integrating the circuit breaker into the service calls

This approach helps to improve the overall fault tolerance and availability of your system by isolating failures and preventing cascading issues across dependent services.
